# Chat App

The Chat App is a real-time chat application that allows users to send messages using AJAX and PHP for an asynchronous request-response cycle. This provides an interactive and engaging user experience when using the application. The application also features a login and sign-up page that allows users to create an account and use it as their profile when using the application.

The Chat App is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, and PHP, with MySQL as the database. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a clean and modern interface.
